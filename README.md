## Why This Exists

Social media management across Meta's platforms — Facebook Pages, Instagram, Threads, Ads Manager, Commerce — requires juggling multiple dashboards, each with its own API quirks and token flows. This server consolidates the entire Meta Graph API surface into a single MCP interface, so your AI assistant can publish content, analyze performance, manage ad campaigns, and moderate engagement across all platforms in one conversation.

Every tool returns actionable error messages — not cryptic API codes. Token expired? You get a regeneration link. Missing permission? You see exactly which one and where to grant it. This means less debugging and more doing.

## Quick Start

Add this entry to `claude_desktop_config.json` under `mcpServers`:

```json
"meta-mcp": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@sigvardt/meta-mcp-server"],
  "env": {
    "META_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<long-lived-token>"
  }
}
```

That's it. Your AI assistant now has access to 200+ Meta tools. `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` is the only required environment variable.

> Need a token? Go to the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer), select your app, and generate one. See [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

### Releases

Claude Desktop pulls the latest published version on each cold start; check the npm page for current version.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sigvardt/meta-mcp-server.git
cd meta-mcp-server
npm install && npm run build
```

---

## Security & Sandbox

This fork enforces a **business-id allowlist** on every Meta Graph API call. By default it is locked to Dynamic Retail ApS (`833812607571849`); override via the `META_ALLOWED_BUSINESS_IDS` environment variable.

### `META_ALLOWED_BUSINESS_IDS`

Comma-separated list of business IDs the server is allowed to touch. At startup, the `BusinessAuthorizationService` fetches each business's owned/client ad accounts, pages, Instagram accounts, pixels, product catalogs, and system users — those IDs form the allowlist. Subsequent API calls are checked against the allowlist before any HTTP request leaves the process.

```bash
# Default (Dynamic Retail only):
# META_ALLOWED_BUSINESS_IDS unset → 833812607571849

# Override with multiple businesses:
export META_ALLOWED_BUSINESS_IDS=833812607571849,1234567890123456
```

### `META_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_MODE`

- `enforce` (default) — fail-closed. Unknown paths return `BUSINESS_AUTH_DENIED` and no HTTP request is sent.
- `warn` — log-and-allow. Useful for dev/diagnostic runs where you want to see what would be blocked without breaking workflows.

### Bypass paths

Certain Graph endpoints aren't business-scoped and are bypassed by the gate. Curated list in `BYPASS_PATHS` (`src/services/business-authorization.ts`) — e.g. `/me`, `/debug_token`, `/oauth/access_token`. Rationale comments live next to each entry.

### Page-token auto-refresh (190/2069032)

When a cached page token returns Meta error `code:190, subcode:2069032` ("page token expired"), the client transparently refreshes the token once (via the user token) and retries the original call. Only applies to cached page tokens (`MetaApiClient.cachePageToken`); won't fire for user tokens or first-time page-token fetches.

### Meta rate-limit pacing

Meta apps can return development-tier rate limits (`code:80004, subcode:2446079`) or app-level request limits (`code:4` with `Application request limit reached`) during bursty Graph API usage. `MetaApiClient` handles those inside the MCP: Graph calls are paced by default and retried with 30s, 60s, and 120s backoff before surfacing the original Meta error.

```bash
# Default: wait at least 5 seconds between Graph calls from one client instance.
export META_RATE_LIMIT_PACE_MS=5000

# Disable pacing, useful only when your app has enough Meta rate-limit headroom.
export META_RATE_LIMIT_PACE_MS=0

# Default: retry recognized Meta rate limits up to 3 times. Set to 0 to fail fast.
export META_RATE_LIMIT_RETRIES=3
```

### Live-acid testing

Real-API integration suite, locked behind a manual trigger:

```bash
# Read-only suite:
RUN_LIVE_ACID=1 npm run test:live

# If the journal gets stuck (e.g. a process crash leaves orphaned test posts):
npm run cleanup:orphans
```

Safety constraints baked into the harness:

- All live posts use a neutral, auto-delete-marker text phrase.
- Intended-delete IDs are appended to `.sisyphus/orphaned-posts.log` (gitignored) **before** the destructive call, so a crash mid-delete still leaves a recoverable trail.
- Successful deletes scrub their entry from the journal.
- `scripts/cleanup-orphans.mjs` runs at startup to retry any leftover journal entries.

## What You Can Do

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Publish everywhere

Post to Facebook Pages (text, photo, video, Reels, Stories), Instagram (photos, reels, stories, carousels), and Threads (text, images, video, GIFs, links). Schedule content in advance or cross-post to multiple platforms in one call.

```
> Post our holiday hours to the Facebook page
> Schedule an Instagram carousel for tomorrow at 9am
> Cross-post this photo to both Facebook and Instagram
> Publish a GIF to Threads with reply controls
> Create a Facebook Reel from this video
> Post a Story to our Facebook page
> Publish an Instagram reel with alt text for accessibility
> Share a link post on Threads with a quote
```

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Manage engagement

Read and reply to comments across platforms, hide inappropriate content without deleting it, manage Instagram DMs and broadcast channels, and set up automated responses for when you're away.

```
> Show me unanswered Instagram DMs
> Hide that offensive comment on our latest post
> Reply to the top 3 comments on yesterday's reel
> Set up an instant reply for new messages
> Set our away message to "Back Monday at 9am"
> Send a DM to that customer who reached out
> What comments did we get on last week's posts?
> Update our Messenger greeting text
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

```
> List all products in our catalog
> Add this new product at $29.99, in stock

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Go live and broadcast

Start Facebook Live video broadcasts for product launches and events, publish Stories for time-sensitive content, and reach your audience directly through Instagram broadcast channels with polls, links, and messages.

```
> Start a live video on our Facebook page
> Send a poll to our Instagram broadcast channel
> Schedule a live stream for Friday at 2pm
> Publish a story to Facebook with this photo
> End the live broadcast
> Send a product announcement to our broadcast channel
> What live videos have we done this month?
> What ads is our competitor running right now?
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Research competitors

Search any advertiser's active ads through Meta's public Ad Library. See what creative, targeting, and spend your competitors are using — no account access needed. Look up any public Instagram business account's stats.

```
> What ads is Nike running in the US right now?
> Search the Ad Library for "sustainable fashion" ads
> Look up @competitor on Instagram — followers and posts
> Show me all active ads by this page ID
> What platforms are they running ads on?
> How much is our competitor spending on ads?
```

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Stay in control

Debug tokens, check permissions, monitor rate limits, verify pixel health, and manage your Business Manager assets. Every error tells you exactly what went wrong and how to fix it — never a cryptic failure.

```
> Check my token status and permissions
> Am I close to Instagram's publishing limit?
> Run a health check on the Meta connection
> Is our pixel receiving events?
> List all ad accounts in our Business Manager
> Share this pixel with our agency's ad account
> What Threads rate limits do we have left?
> Debug why this API call is failing
```

### 1. Create a Meta App

Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com) → **My Apps** → **Create App** → choose **Business** type. Add **Facebook Login**, **Pages API**, **Instagram Graph API**, and **Marketing API**.

### 2. Generate Tokens

Get a token from the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer), then exchange it for a long-lived token (60 days):

```bash
curl "https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?\
grant_type=fb_exchange_token&\
client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&\
client_secret=YOUR_APP_SECRET&\
fb_exchange_token=SHORT_LIVED_TOKEN"
```

> **For permanent access**, create a System User token in Business Manager → System Users.

**Threads** uses a separate token via `graph.threads.net` OAuth — see [Threads API docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads/get-started).

### 1Password Integration

If `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `THREADS_ACCESS_TOKEN` are not set in the environment, the server automatically attempts to resolve them from [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/):

```
op://Development/Meta Access Token/credential
op://Development/Threads Access Token/credential
```

This means you can skip setting env vars entirely if you have `op` installed and a service account or session active. The fallback adds ~1-2s to startup per token and is silently skipped if 1Password is unavailable.

### 3. Grant Permissions

| Permission | Required for |
|:---|:---|
| `pages_show_list` | Listing pages |
| `pages_read_engagement` | Page insights, reactions |
| `pages_manage_posts` | Creating, editing, deleting posts |
| `pages_manage_metadata` | Page settings, webhooks, profile picture, cover photo |
| `pages_read_user_content` | Tagged posts, visitor posts, ratings |
| `pages_messaging` | Reading and sending messages, automated responses |
| `instagram_basic` | Instagram account info |
| `instagram_content_publish` | Publishing photos, reels, stories, carousels |
| `instagram_manage_insights` | Instagram analytics |
| `instagram_manage_comments` | Comment management |
| `instagram_manage_messages` | Instagram DMs |
| `ads_read` | Reading campaigns, ad sets, ads, insights |
| `ads_management` | Creating and managing ads, A/B tests |
| `business_management` | Business Manager assets, product catalogs |
| `catalog_management` | Product catalog CRUD |
| `threads_basic` | Threads profile and posts |
| `threads_content_publish` | Publishing to Threads |
| `threads_manage_insights` | Threads analytics |
| `threads_manage_replies` | Managing Threads replies |

### 4. Connect to Your MCP Client

**Claude Code** — add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meta": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/meta-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "META_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_long_lived_token",
        "THREADS_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_threads_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Works with any MCP client that supports **stdio transport**. `THREADS_ACCESS_TOKEN` is optional — only needed for Threads tools.

---

## How It Works

The server starts without any tokens configured — no crashes, no "failed" status in MCP settings. When you call a tool without proper auth, you get a clear setup message.

**First call should always be `meta_list_pages`** — this caches the page-scoped access tokens required for all Page and Instagram operations.

### Error Handling

Every error message tells you what went wrong, why, and how to fix it:

| What happened | What you see |
|:---|:---|
| No token set | Step-by-step setup instructions with link to Graph Explorer |
| Token expired (code 190) | Direct link to regenerate at developers.facebook.com |
| Missing permission (code 10/200) | Names the exact permission needed and where to grant it |
| Rate limited (429) | Tells you to wait, links to Meta's rate limit docs |
| Page token missing | Reminds you to call `meta_list_pages` first |
| Network unreachable | "Cannot reach graph.facebook.com — check your connection" |

### Token Refresh

Long-lived tokens expire after 60 days. Use `meta_debug_token` to check expiry, then refresh:

```bash
curl "https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?\
grant_type=fb_exchange_token&\
client_id=APP_ID&client_secret=APP_SECRET&\
fb_exchange_token=CURRENT_TOKEN"
```

> For permanent tokens, create a System User in Business Manager → System Users.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Dual API client** — Handles both `graph.facebook.com/v21.0` and `graph.threads.net/v1.0` with separate base URLs and tokens
- **Page token caching** — `meta_list_pages` caches page-scoped tokens; subsequent tools look them up by page ID
- **Two-step container publishing** — Instagram and Threads require container → publish flow; the server handles this automatically with video processing polling
- **Parallel carousel processing** — All carousel items created concurrently via `Promise.allSettled`; partial failures report which items succeeded
- **Zod strict schemas** — Every tool uses strict Zod schemas for type-safe parameter validation
- **Dual output format** — Every read tool supports `response_format: "markdown"` or `"json"`
- **Graceful auth** — Server starts without tokens, returns setup instructions on first tool call instead of crashing
- **Chart generation** — QuickChart integration for rendering data as PNG images for reports

## Development

Use the same commands for local development and contribution checks:

```bash
npm install
npm test            # 52 tests
npm run build       # TypeScript compilation
npm run test:watch  # Development mode
```

Development conventions: Zod `.strict()` schemas, `response_format` parameter on read tools, and `errorResult()` for tool errors with `isError: true`.
